    <h2>About Me & My Background</h2>
   
    <p>
     I am income struggling 19 year old freelancer and a Media Strategies comms student that lives in the U.S.
    I have a passion for multimedia art, coding, script writing, creating/editing video content, and being a jack of all trades. 
    I am striving to create my own art business centered around making memorable experiences people can 
    have with friends, family, and even random co-workers. But before I do that I want to find more 
    of my identity and already make a stable and steady living. 
    Random tidbit I love the series Invader Zim and the series Bojark Hosemen...
